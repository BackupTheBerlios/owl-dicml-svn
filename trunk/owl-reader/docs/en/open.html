	<h1>Open a dictionary</h1>
	Click on »Menu, Open dictionary«.<br><br>
	This will open a dialog where you can choose the file of the dictionary you want to open. Click on »Open« after that.<br><br>
	Maybe you are asked wether you want to index the dictionary. That has to happen at the first use. Click on »Yes«.<br><br>
	<i><b>hint: </b></i>If you get error-messages when opening a dictionary or when you installed a new version of an existing one use »Options, Force indexing« to re-index the dictionary.<br><br>
	Now choose an entry from the list or type the searched word into the text-box. When opening the first dictionary after starting owl it may take some seconds until the entry is shown.<br><br>
      If you want that this dictionary is automatically loaded the next time you start owl, activate »Options, Load this dictionary at next start-up«.<br>
      You can also give the path to the dictionary as argument at the command line.<br><br>
